# ðŸš€ Algorithms & Data Structures Collection



Welcome to my comprehensive collection of **algorithms**, **data structures**, and **programming projects**! This repository serves as both a learning resource and a reference implementation for fundamental computer science concepts. Here some features


- **Multiple Programming Languages**: Starting with Python, expanding to Java, C++, JavaScript, and more
- **Clean, Well-Documented Code**: Each implementation includes detailed comments and explanations
- **Time & Space Complexity Analysis**: Big O notation provided for all algorithms
- **Test Cases**: Comprehensive test suites for reliability
- **Real-World Applications**: Practical projects demonstrating algorithm usage




## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Your preferred programming language runtime (Python, Java, C++, etc.)
- Git for version control
- A code editor or IDE

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:MegumiSharp/Personal-Code-Snippets.git
   cd Personal-Code-Snippets/
   ```

2. **Set up your development environment**
   - Install the required language runtime for the implementations you want to run
   - Set up your preferred IDE or text editor
   - Install any language-specific dependencies as needed

3. **Navigate to your preferred language**
   ```bash
   # For Python implementations
   cd algorithms/python/

   # For Java implementations
   cd algorithms/java/

   # For C++ implementations
   cd algorithms/cpp/
   ```
